Clinton: Eight Years of Peace, Progress and Prosperity</a></b></p>
<p>In 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore put in place an agenda to get America back on its economic feet while restoring the values of opportunity, responsibility and community that made this country great.  Their work, along with the hard work of the American people, has led to remarkable progress: the longest economic expansion in our nation's history, more than 22 million new jobs, historically low unemployment, the lowest crime rates in a generation, the smallest welfare rolls in 35 years, and cleaner air and water in our nation's communities.  Our report "Eight Years of Peace, Progress and Prosperity" highlights all of President Clinton's historic achievements and details the progress our nation has made over the past eight years.  The report is available in HTML and as a PDF here on the White House web site. <a HREF="/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-index.html">read more</a>
