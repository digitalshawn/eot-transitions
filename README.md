## Project Background
This project came about as part of the Archives Unleashed 3.0 event hosted at the Internet Archive Feb 23-24, 2017. The group came together around an interest in using the End of Term web archives to assess change in the web presence of each presidential administration - at the time of transition. We hoped to use multiple ways of characterising six government domains over a three month period around the  2001/2005/2009/2013/2017 transitions. The goal was to assess whether the rate and type of change between different administrations. The following is a sketch of what we did and some of our preliminary findings.

Ultimately the group wanted to test some hypotheses around whether change in the government's web presence could be characterised as differently across different transitions. Some inspiration here was taken from recent public outcry over the Trump administration's 'scrubbing' or changing of the whitehouse.gov website. Here we investigate whether we can truly say that there is something different here, or...?

## Metrics for measuring change
The team brainstormed various achievable metrics for observing change in the web presence of each administration.

### Side-by-Side Visual
We used -- to first produce thumbnails for each memento (queried from the CDX server in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine) for the home page of the 6 chosen domains. This was used as a preliminary mechanism to visualise broad scale change, and as a potential way to deep dive into the web archives.
