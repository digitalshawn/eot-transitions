## Project Background
This project came about as part of the Archives Unleashed 3.0 event hosted at the Internet Archive Feb 23-24, 2017. The group came together around an interest in using the End of Term web archives to assess change in the web presence of each presidential administration - at the time of transition. We hoped to use multiple ways of characterising six government domains over a three month period around the  2001/2005/2009/2013/2017 transitions. The goal was to assess whether the rate and type of change between different administrations. The following is a sketch of what we did and some of our preliminary findings.

## Metrics for measuring change
The team brainstormed various achievable metrics for observing change in the web presence of each administration.

### Side-by-Side Visual
We used -- to first produce thumbnails for each memento for the home page of the 6 chosen domains. This was used as a preliminary mechanism to visualise broad scale change
